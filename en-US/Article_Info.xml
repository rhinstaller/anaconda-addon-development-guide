          The Anaconda installer is a piece of software used to install &FEDORA;, &RHEL; and their
derivatives. Since the installation is internally a complicated process and there are many aspects
of the resulting system that need to be configured during installation it has been decided that the
Anaconda installer needs to support dynamically loaded plugins (addons) that will be developed and
maintained by other teams and people specialized in certain areas. This guide should help those
people writting an Anaconda addon to get an insight to the architecture and basic principles used by
the Anaconda installer as well as an overview of the API and helper functions provided.
